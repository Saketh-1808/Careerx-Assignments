        <p>Batting maestro Virat Kohli finally managed to end his Test century drought on Sunday by reaching the triple-figure mark on Sunday against Australia in the fourth and final Test match. Kohli showed grit and resilience to score his 28th Test century. It was a very long wait for the former India skipper as his 27th Test ton came way back in November 2019 against Bangladesh in a day-night Test.
        </p>
        <p> Several things changed between Kohli’s last two Test centuries as he was the skipper back then when he scripted history by scoring a ton in India’s first day-night clash. While he relinquished the Test captaincy last year and now plays in the team as a specialist batter</p>
        <p> Kohli reflected on ending his century drought with his 75th international ton with a Player-of-the-Match performance.

          “The expectations that I have for myself as a player are more important to me. I think in Test cricket I wasn’t able to play with my tempo and template that I have played with for the last 10 years for a while now. So that was the one thing I was trying to do.,” said Kohli.
          
          Kohli’s 364-ball 186 was the highest individual score this series and the former India skipper amassed 297 runs overall at an average of 49.50.</p>
        <p> “I was happy with my defence. I am not in a space now where I will go out and prove someone wrong. I also need to justify why I am there on the field. When I was 60 not out, we decided to play positively. But we lost Shreyas thanks to injury. So, we decided to play time. They were good with the ball and placed some good fields. We got a bit of a lead and gave ourself some sort of a chance.” he added.</p>
